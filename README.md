hello...world

I'm Richard, I work in biotech and am taking CS50 as a hobby, because I apparently like painful hobbies.
I joined GitHub because my company's website crashed and it is my responsibility to manage the website :(.
Google led me to a program on GitHub that helped get my website back up.  Thanks GitHub!  Thanks Google!
